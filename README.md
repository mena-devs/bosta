[![Build Status](https://menadevs.semaphoreci.com/badges/bosta.svg?style=shields)](https://menadevs.semaphoreci.com/projects/bosta)

## Synopsis

[MENA-Devs](https://menadevs.com/)'s Slack Greek Emperor

## Installation & Configuration

### Minimum Requirements

```
NodeJS v10.15.x
```

The code uses ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) *shipping* features. If you're
building/submitting plugins please avoid using staged/in progress features.

### Configure and Run

Install the dependencies using:

```
$ npm install
```

Retrieve your bot token and add a custom incoming webhook (if winston is enabled in your configuration file) from slack and create a `secret.json` file as follows:

```
{
    "winston_webhook": "webhook-url-here",
    "token": "your-bot-token-here",
    "menadevs_api_token": "this is a token specific to MENA Devs purposes",
    "wolframalpha_app_id": "APP_ID"
}
```

then start the bot using

```
$ npm start
```

Plugins may have their own installation requirements that are covered as part
of the plugin's own documentation.

Alternatively, you can build and run bosta through docker. Simply make sure your `secret.json` is available and run the following commands:

```
$ docker build -t bosta:latest .
$ docker run --rm -ti bosta:latest
```

## Available Plugins

### Ping

Simple ping/pong handler; you can change the text in the configuration file.

### Wikipedia

Fetches the _extract_ of a search from wikipedia and only displays the first
line. You can configure the amount of text displayed in the configuration file.

### Figlet

Displays funky text.

### Sentiment Analysis

Provides sentiment analysis over a user's last N-messages. The plugin uses
[DatumBox's Sentiment Analysis API](http://www.datumbox.com/api-sandbox/#!/Document-Classification/SentimentAnalysis_post_0)
 and you must provide the API key in your `secret.json`:

```json
{
    ...
    "datumbox": "api-token-here"
}
```

### Spell Checker

This plugin will automatically check the spelling of words that are followed
by `(sp?)`. Example:

```
John: This may end up being idiocyncracy(sp?). What did you see?
Bosta: possible spelling for idiosyncracy: idiosyncrasy, idiosyncratic, ...
```

### Tell-Me-About

A rudimentary, persistent, user-configured responder. It's purpose is to allow
users to configure shortcuts to commonly used text. Example:

```
John: @bosta save sscce as: Short, Self Contained, Correct, Example. Read more
about it here http://sscce.org/
bosta: sscce saved.
John: about sscce
bosta: sscce: Short, Self Contained, Correct, Example. Read more
about it here http://sscce.org/
```

### Snippets

The snippets plugin is capable of executing user submitted snippets and report
back the results:

#### How to use?

- When a user _shares_ a snippet and sets the language, if the bot supports
that language, it will execute it and report back the result as a comment on
the snippet itself.
- The bot would also execute subsequent shares of the same snippet (changed or
otherwise).
- The user is capable of using the `:repeat:` emoji as a reaction to force a
re-evaluation of the snippet.
- You can check the language support using `snippets support`
- You can check the language configuration using `snippets config <lang>`

#### What are the concerns?

- Is it safe? Yes, it's very safe; the bot uses containers to execute the
snippets and as such your system is protected (hopefully, for the most part).
- What about memory? The plugin allows you to control how much memory is
allocated for every container/language.
- What about infinite/long running operations? The plugin allows you to control
the timeout for every container/language

#### Dependencies

System the snippet executor is heavily dependant on Docker, you will need to
ensure that you have a working docker configuration. The bot was tested against
the following versions:

```
Docker version 1.11.2
docker-machine version 0.7.0
```

#### Configuration

In order to allow the bot to execute commands, you need to make sure that you
have the corresponding docker images specified in `config.json`:

```
"python": {
    "command": "python",
    "image": "python:latest",
    "memory": 8,
    "timeout": 4
}
```

Simply install the proper image (in the example above `docker pull python:latest`)

### User Requests

This plugin takes a invite request from any MENA Devs member and pushes it to assigned admins for action.

#### Supported Requests

- Invitation request

### Hacker News

Retrieves up to (N) top stories from YCombinator's Hacker News

### New User

Manually triggered command to send a greeting to any member and push the MENA Dev's Code of Conduct to them in a private message sent by the Bot.

### Lira

TBD @aymanfarhat

### WolframAlpha

Integration with the computational knowledge engine. Used to answer a variety of calculable questions.

#### Configuration

The `secrets.json` file should contain a WolframAlpha app id as follows:

```
    "wolframalpha_app_id": "APP_ID"
```
